This will be a place for all the documentation to the usage of applications that enthusiasts may want to use to improve their workflows. Ideally, this site should be linked by my public repositories READMEs for a more recommended approach, as the software that I publicize should be easily ran and modified without the need to look for information externally.

If you'd like to contribute, please visit <https://github.com/akippnn/docs>.

As for now, this site is currently a work-in-progress.
